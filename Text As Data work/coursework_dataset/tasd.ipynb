        "\n",
        "In Q4, we directly applied feature extraction using the bert-base-uncased model to assess the cosine similarity between questions and their options, which yielded surprisingly poor results. This outcome, though unexpected, serves as a crucial discovery, highlighting the limitations of applying a pre-trained model without task-specific fine-tuning.The reasons may include, but are not limited to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lack of Task-Specific Optimization**: Pre-trained models might not fully grasp the complex semantic relationships between questions and options because they haven't been optimized for a specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Insufficient Detail from [CLS] Vectors**: While [CLS] vectors capture the context of the entire input sequence, they may not distinguish between very similar text fragments finely enough.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Limitations of Cosine Similarity**: Although cosine similarity is a method to measure the similarity between text vectors, it might not capture the subtle semantic differences between texts adequately.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations in Q2\n",
        "\n",
        "In Q2, we employed set similarity measures (like Jaccard similarity, Sorensen-Dice coefficient, and Overlap coefficient) to assess the similarity between texts. These methods, grounded in set theory, compare the overlap between two sets of texts (e.g., sets of words), with limitations including:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ignoring Word Order and Context: Set similarity methods typically overlook the order of words and their contextual environment within texts, potentially reducing accuracy in understanding semantic relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplified Text Representation: These approaches reduce texts to sets of words, ignoring the semantic complexity and polysemy of words, possibly failing to capture more subtle semantic differences between texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations in Q3\n",
        "\n",
        "In Q3, we calculated cosine similarity using [CLS] vectors derived from the bert-base-uncased model. Although this approach better captures the text's context compared to Q2's methods, it still has limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Fixed Vector Representation: Compressing each text into a fixed-size vector might lose some information crucial for specific tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfine-tuned Pre-trained Model: If the pre-trained model is used directly without task-specific fine-tuning, it might not fully adapt to the specific demands of the task, leading to suboptimal performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations in Q4\n",

        "Considering a test accuracy of 65%, this indicates that the model can correctly predict about two-thirds of the questions. Such accuracy might be acceptable in some application scenarios, especially those with a relatively high tolerance for errors, such as preliminary content recommendations, user engagement enhancements, or as an auxiliary tool in educational applications. In these cases, the model can serve as a useful aid to help users filter potentially valuable content from a vast amount of information or provide preliminary guidance, with the final decisions still left to the users.\n",

        "However, if the application scenario demands high accuracy, such as in professional knowledge Q&A systems, medical consultations, or legal advisory services, a 65% accuracy rate is clearly insufficient. In these fields, incorrect information could lead to serious consequences, and users rely on the system's information to make important decisions. Therefore, it is necessary to improve accuracy through more in-depth model training, data augmentation, optimization of the model structure, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while a 65% accuracy rate might be considered sufficient for some lightweight or preliminary applications, this performance level is far from adequate for scenarios requiring high-precision predictions. As a responsible researcher, I suggest further enhancing the model's performance before actual deployment to ensure it can provide high-quality, reliable predictions in the targeted application scenarios. Additionally, considering introducing a manual review mechanism as a supplement should also be considered to improve the overall system's accuracy and reliability."
